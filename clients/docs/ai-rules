#GLOBAL AI RULES:
- Always read /docs before coding
- UI code must follow ui-spec.md
- Business logic lives in /services
- API routes only orchestrate, not implement logic
- No new patterns without explicit instruction
- Ask before deviating from established patterns
- Write tests for all new code  
- Follow existing code style and conventions
- Document new code and APIs clearly
